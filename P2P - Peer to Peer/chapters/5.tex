\chapter{Blockchain}
The basic concepts concerning Blockchains are
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textit{Ledger}
   \item \textit{Consensus} in a distributed environment
   \item Tamper freeness
   \item Proof of ownership
   \item Permissioned and permissionless blockchains
\end{itemize}

Each \textbf{block} is made up of \textit{Data}, \textit{Hash} and the \textit{Hash of the previous block}.

\textbf{Tamper freeness} refers to changing one hash causes changing the hash of the following blocks, implying not only to recompute some hashes, but also to find a value that combined with the new hash solves the \textit{Proof of Work}.

A \textbf{ledger}\footnote{\textit{``Libro mastro''} in italiano} acts like a notary, and is replicated on each node of a P2P network, it is immutable and benefits of the tamper freeness property.\\
The ledger is like a bullettin storing operations and their order. It must be an \textbf{append-only} list of events, and also \textbf{tamper-proof}.

\textbf{Consensus} is the mechanism which defines who decides which operation will be added to the blockchain, and which operation among those to be confirmed will be added.


The two main challenges for the ledger are keeping consistency in case of network jitter and possible delays, and avoid nodes to fake results.
An idea is to establish \textit{consensus} using a \textbf{Proof of Work}, which requires the voting system to be hardly fakeable, i.e. resolving a difficult computational problem.
