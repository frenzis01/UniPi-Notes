\chapter{Hardhat and Solidity}

Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum that allows you to write, test, and deploy smart contracts. It is a popular tool among Ethereum developers because it provides a lot of useful features, such as built-in testing and debugging tools, and it is easy to use.

Hardhat is JavaScript based, which means that you can write your smart contracts in Solidity and your tests in JavaScript. This makes it easy to write tests for your smart contracts and to integrate them into your development workflow.
