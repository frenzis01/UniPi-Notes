\chapter{IoT Design Aspects}
Each device is usually low power and low cost small and autonomous system, equipped with processor, memory and radio transceiver along with sensing and/or actuating elements, with everything being powered a battery (or something equivalent such as solar cells).

The main limitations in the design of IoT devices are due to the abovementioned components ---aside from the sensors/actuators--- and is not clear whether technology improvements will overcome such constraints.  

\section{Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Energy efficiency
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item sensors are battery-powered or use energy
      harvesting
      \item need for HW/SW energy efficient solutions
   \end{enumerate}
   \item Adaptatability to changing conditions
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item need for dynamic network management &
      programming
   \end{enumerate}
   \item Low-complexity, low overhead protocols
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item need at any level of the protocol stack due
      to limitation of nodes’ resources
   \end{enumerate}
   \item Security
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item at all layers ot the stack
   \end{enumerate}
   \item Multihop communications
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item need for protocol stacks & routing
      protocols
   \end{enumerate}
   \item Mobility
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Need for dynamic routing protocols
      Data storage & (pre-)processing
   \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Moore's law}
\begin{center}
   
   \textit{``The number of transistors that can be (inexpensively) embedded in a chip grows exponentially''}
   
   In other words, \textit{``it doubles every two years''}
\end{center}

Three different ---but equally true--- interpretations may be given to such law:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item The performance doubles every two years at the same cost
   \note{Up to now this is true for processors of servers/desktops}
   \item The chip’s size halves every two years at the same cost
   \note{Consequently also the energy consumption is reduced}
   \item The size and the processing power remain the same but the cost
   halves every two years
\end{enumerate}
