\chapter{MQTT}
Things must be connected to the Internet to become
\textit{``IoT"} devices, and thus to adopt the internet
protocol suite (TCP/IP + application, usually HTTP).
However, the Internet stack is thought for \textit{resource-rich} devices, not for IoT ones.\\
These led the canonical protocol stack to be modified 

\textbf{MQTT} is a publish-subscribe application protocol.
