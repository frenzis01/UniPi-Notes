   All these standards \texttt{use \texttt{CSMA/CA} for multiple access}, and have base-station and ad-hoc network versions

IEEE 802.11 standards refer to the \textit{Physical} Layer.
In case of an AP (Access Point), every station must channel its communication through the AP to talk to any other. Otherwise, in an \textit{Ad-Hoc} network, stations can communicate directly with each other.
