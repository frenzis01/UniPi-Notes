The key point in \textbf{3G} is the introduction of a data service, operating in parallel with voice network, which forced the important modifications to the architecture.

In \textbf{4G} also the voice traffic uses \textit{packet switching}, instead of circuit switching.

\framedt{Control vs Data plane}{
   \textbf{Control plane} includes routing protocols such as BGP and all the processes which handle and determine how data packets should be forwarded.
   
   \textbf{Data plane} instead handles the transport of host/application data, and performs the actually forwarding of packets.
   
   \textit{\footnotesize``Think of the control plane as being like the stoplights that operate at the intersections of a city. Meanwhile, the data plane (or the forwarding plane) is more like the cars that drive on the roads, stop at the intersections, and obey the stoplights''}
