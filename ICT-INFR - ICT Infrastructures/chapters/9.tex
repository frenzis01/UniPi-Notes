\chapter{Cloud}
Cloud came out as a business model, not as a technlogy.
It was needed to handle peak of requests and to allow scalability, without oversizing Infrastructures.
\note{e.g. Amazon needs to handle way more requests on Christmas than on a normal day.}
So, Cloud was a mean to reduce the cost of the ICT infrastructure.
