\begin{enumerate}
   \item 
   \textit{Do you think that cabling may affect the PUE?}\\
   Yes, because the cabling may affect the airflow and the cooling system, which in turn may affect the PUE.
   But not only this, because part of such PUE may be hidden in the ``compute'' part of a system:
   fans inside the servers, when detecting a higher temperature, may increase their speed, (or lower the CPU performance) thus consuming more energy.

% Spine-leaf must be related to protocol SFP, because it is a protocol that is used to connect switches in a data center.

\section{Domande mie}

\subsection{What is the standard voltage of incoming power in a data center? Where does the conversion from AC to DC happen?}
380V, and the conversion happens in the UPS, sometimes there may be a dedicated component to the conversion.

\subsection{Three-tier architecture: What does it mean that ``provides active-passive redundancy which leads to inefficient east west traffic''?}

The three-tier architecture provides active-passive redundancy because the multiple paths provided by the various switches, are used only one at time, since the RSTP protocol blocks the other paths, in order to avoid loops. This leads to inefficient east-west traffic because the traffic is not distributed across all the links, but only one at a time.
   

\subsection{Optane can perform 416 accesses in the same time needed by a mechanical hard drive to perform 1 access. It looks like the latency in this latter case is neglegtible. Someone may be tempted to reduce the size of read/write operations and perform multiple smaller ones, since ``it's free''. Why is this not a good idea or why is it?}

Answer by Copilot: ``Because the time needed to perform the operation is not the only factor to consider. The time needed to prepare the operation, and the time needed to manage the operation, are also important. If we perform multiple smaller operations, we need to prepare and manage each of them, which may lead to a higher overall time needed to perform the operations.''
