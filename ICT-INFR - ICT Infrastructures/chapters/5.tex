\section{Storage}

\begin{paracol}{2}
   
   Historically the storage was the slowest part of the system, \textit{ms} against \textit{ns} of the CPU.
   Today, with SSDs, the gap is considerably reduced to \textit{us}.
   
   \ul{NVMe stands for \textit{Non-Volatile Memory Express}, and is a protocol (\textit{not a HW component!})} that allows to access the storage directly from the PCIe bus, without having to go through the SATA controller. This allows to have a much higher throughput, and a much lower latency.

   \note{Optane was a technology developed by intel which is now end of life}
