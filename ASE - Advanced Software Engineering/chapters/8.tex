\chapter{as a Service}

In traditionally distributed software,
customers had to configure, manage updates, while producers had to mantain different product versions; 
in \textbf{Saas} instead,
a product is delivered as a \textbf{service}, thus there's no need to install anything,
and there is a form of monthly (and/or pay-per-usage) subscription, to use the service.

\section{Benefits and cons}
\textit{\textbf{Producer} point of view}
\begin{itemize}
   \color{darkgreen}
   \item Regular cash flow
   \item Easier and less costful update management
   \item Continuous deployment: a new software version can be deployed as soon as it is tested
   \item Payment flexibility, making room for different subscription plans possibly attracting a wider range of users
   \item Try-before-you-buy options are easily available without fearing piracy, besides they'd make the product look more appealing to new customers
   \item Telemetry and data collection are way easier and hardly avoidable by customers   
\end{itemize}

\textit{\textbf{Consumer} point of view}
\begin{itemize}
   \color{darkgreen}
   \item Mobile, laptop and desktop access
   \item No upfront costs for software or servers
   \item Immediate and transparent software updates
   \item Reduced software management costs
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
   \color{darkred}
   \item Privacy regulation conformance
   \item Security concerns
   \item Network constraints may limit the usability of the software
   \item Data exchange from/to services might be difficult if the service doesn't provide a suitable API
\end{itemize}

\section{Design issues}
When designing Saas there are some critical points the developers has to make decisions on:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Authentication} method: federated auth, personal auth, \textit{Google/Linkedin/...} credentials... 
   \item Whether some features should be available \textbf{locally}
   \item \textbf{Info leakage}
   \item \textit{Multi-tenant} vs \textit{multi-instance} \textbf{DB management}:
   i.e. single repository vs separate copies of system and database
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DB management}
\subsubsection{Multi-tenant}
\textbf{Multi-tenant} systems forsee a single DB schema shared by all system's users,
where DB items are tagged with a \textit{tenant identifier} to provide some form of "logical isolation".

Mid-size and large businesses rarely want to use a generic multi-tenant software, 
they often prefer a customized version adapted to their own requirements.

(...)

(Solutions I and II)

(...)

\textbf{Security} is the makor concern of corporate customers with multi-tenant systems,
since a centralized DB may represent a single point-of-failure for data leak or damage.\\
A common solution is to implement \textbf{multilevel access control}, checking data access both at the organizational level and at individual level.
A technlogy which can clearly help in this matter is \textbf{encryption},
however it might cripple performance.

\subsubsection{Multi-instance}
Multi-instance may mainly be \textbf{VM}-based or \textbf{Container}-based.\\
With \textit{containers}, each user has an \textbf{isolated} version of software and database running in a set of container,
defining a solution perfect for products whose users work onto independently from others.\\
With the other solution instead, for each \textbf{customer} there is a VM running an instance of the DB \textbf{shared} and accessible to all customer's users.\nl

Let's consider pros and cons of such a solution.
Flexibility, security, scalability ... pros
Update costs ... cons

\section{Architectural decisions}
Software and scalability and Resilience\\
monolithic or service oriented\\
multi-tenant or multi-instance DB\\
\textit{What cloud platform fits best development and delivery?}

\subsection{Scalability}
To allow scalability on cloud-based systems,
the product implementation must be organized so that the individual software components can be replicated and run in parallel,
besides, also a load-balancing mechanism must be implemented.

\subsection{Resilience}
Achieving resilience can be done through \textit{hot/cool standby}.
The difference lies in the fact that while cool standby relies restarting the system using backup copies of the data,
hot standby forsees a clone-instance running at the same time of the main one with a mirrored DB:
in case of system failure,
there is and entire backup system which can take its place while the main recovers.
This is clearly more costful, but more effective.
