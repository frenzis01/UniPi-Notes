\chapter{Cluster analysis}


Finding groups of objects such that the objects in a group
will be similar (or related) to one another and different
from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups.

The aim of clustering is to ease data \textbf{understanding} and \textbf{summarization}, i.e. reduce the size of data sets.

\note{
	The following are \textit{NOT} cluster analysis:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simple segmentation
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Dividing students into different registration groups
		\end{itemize}
		alphabetically, by last name
		\item Results of a query
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Groupings are a result of an external specification
			      \item Clustering is a grouping of objects based on the data
		      \end{itemize}
		\item Supervised classification
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Have class label information
		      \end{itemize}
		\item Association Analysis
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Local vs. global connections
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	These ain't clustering essentially because there is no \textbf{similarity} measure involved, which instead is the core of clustering.

\section{Definitions}
A \textbf{clustering} is a set of clusters. There is an important distinction between hierarchical and
partitional sets of clusters.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Partitional} Clustering\\
	A division of data objects into non-overlapping subsets
	(clusters) such that each data object is in exactly one subset.
	\item \textit{Hierarchical} Clustering\\
	A set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchical tree.
\end{itemize}

	\caption{Partitional vs Hierarchical clustering}
	\label{fig:04/partitional_hierarchical}
\end{figure}


There are other distinctions among clusterings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exclusive versus non-exclusive
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item In non-exclusive clusterings, points may belong to multiple
	      \end{itemize}
	      clusters.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Can represent multiple classes or ‘border’ points
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Fuzzy versus non-fuzzy
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item In fuzzy clustering, a point belongs to every cluster with some
		            weight between 0 and 1
		      \item Weights must sum to 1
		      \item Probabilistic clustering has similar characteristics
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Partial versus complete
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item In some cases, we only want to cluster some of the data
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Heterogeneous versus homogeneous
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Clusters of widely different sizes, shapes, and densities
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Clustering}
% // TODO add pictures
\begin{itemize}
	\item Well-separated clusters
	      A cluster is a set of points such that any point in a cluster is closer (or more similar) to every other point in the cluster than to any point not in the cluster
	\item Center-based clusters
	      \begin{paracol}{2}

		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item A cluster is a set of objects such that an object in a cluster is
			            closer (more similar) to the “center” of a cluster, than to the
			            center of any other cluster
			      \item The center of a cluster is often a centroid, the average of all
			            the points in the cluster, or a medoid, the most “representative”
			            point of a cluster
		      \end{itemize}

	\item Contiguous clusters (Nearest neighbor or

		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Each point is closer to at least one point in its cluster than to
			            any point in another cluster.
			      \item Graph based clustering
			      \item This approach can have trouble when noise is present since a
			            small bridge of points can merge two distinct clusters

\section{Similarity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Similarity
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Numerical measure of how alike two data objects are.
              \item Is higher when objects are more alike.
              \item Often falls in the range [0,1]
          \end{itemize}
    \item Dissimilarity
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Numerical measure of how different are two data objects
              \item Lower when objects are more alike
              \item Minimum dissimilarity is often 0
              \item Upper limit varies
          \end{itemize}
    \item Proximity refers to a similarity or dissimilarity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Similarity and Dissimilarity for Different Attribute Types}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Similarity and dissimilarity for simple attributes}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Attribute Type} & \textbf{Dissimilarity} & \textbf{Similarity} \\
\hline
Nominal & 
$d = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } p = q \\
1 & \text{if } p \neq q
\end{cases}$ & 
$s = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } p = q \\
0 & \text{if } p \neq q
\end{cases}$ \\
\hline
Ordinal & 
$d = \frac{|p-q|}{n-1}$

(values mapped to integers 0 to $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of values) & 
$s = 1 - \frac{|p-q|}{n-1}$ \\
\hline
Interval or Ratio & 
$d = |p - q|$ & 
$s = -d$, $s = \frac{1}{1+d}$ or

$s = 1 - \frac{d-min\_d}{max\_d-min\_d}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:similarity_attributes}
\end{table}

$p$ and $q$ are the attribute values for two data objects.

\subsection{Euclidean Distance}
The most common way to measure distance between two data objects is the Euclidean distance:

\[
d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k - y_k)^2}
\]

where $n$ is the number of dimensions (attributes) and $x_k$ and $y_k$ are, respectively, the $k^{th}$ attributes (components) or data objects $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$. Standardization is necessary, if scales differ.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Standardization is necessary, if scales differ.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Minkowski Distance}

Minkowski Distance is a generalization of Euclidean Distance. $r$ is a parameter that defines the type of distance, $n$ is the number of dimensions (attributes) and $x_k$ and $y_k$ are, respectively, the $k^{th}$ attributes (components) or data objects $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$.

\[
d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{n} |x_k - y_k|^r\right)^{\frac{1}{r}}
\]

\begin{itemize}
	\item For $r=1$, it is the Manhattan distance (or city block/Hamming distance)
	\item For $r=2$, it is the Euclidean distance
	\item For $r \rightarrow \infty$, it is the supremum distance (or Chebyshev distance)
\end{itemize}

\framedt{Metrics and Similiraties}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $d(x, y) \geq 0$ for all $x$ and $y$ and $d(x, y) = 0$ only if
		      $x = y$. (Positive definiteness)
		\item $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ for all $x$ and $y$. (Symmetry)
		\item $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ for all points $x$, $y$, and $z$ (Triangle Inequality).
	\end{enumerate}
	A \textit{distance} $d$ is a \textit{metric} if it satisfies the three conditions above.

	\begin{enumerate}
			\item $s(x, y) = 1$ (or maximum similarity) only if $x = y$.
			\item $s(x, y) = s(y, x)$ for all $x$ and $y$. (Symmetry)
	\end{enumerate}
	These instead are properties of a \textit{similarity} measure.
}

\subsection{Binary Similarity}
Computing similarity among objects described by binary attributes is slightly different from numerical attributes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simple Matching Coefficient (SMC)
	      \[
		      SMC = \frac{\texttt{\#matches}}{\texttt{\#attributes}}=\frac{f_{11} + f_{00}}{f_{11} + f_{10} + f_{01} + f_{00}}
	      \]
	\item Jaccard Coefficient
	      \[
		      J = \frac{\texttt{\#}11\texttt{matches}}{\texttt{\#non-zero attribute values}}\frac{f_{11}}{f_{11} + f_{10} + f_{01}}
	      \]
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
	p &= 1\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\\
	q &= 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\\
	f_{01} &= 2 \text{ (\#attributes where } p \text{ was 0 and } q \text{ was 1)}\\
	f_{10} &= 1 \text{ (\#attributes where } p \text{ was 1 and } q \text{ was 0)}\\
	f_{00} &= 7 \text{ (\#attributes where } p \text{ was 0 and } q \text{ was 0)}\\
	f_{11} &= 0 \text{ (\#attributes where } p \text{ was 1 and } q \text{ was 1)}\\
	SMC &= \frac{0 + 7}{10} = 0.7\\
	J &= \frac{0}{0 + 1 + 2} = 0
\end{align*}

\subsection{Cosine Similarity}
Used often in text mining, where each dimension corresponds to a term (word) and the value
of the dimension is the frequency of the term in the document.

If $d_1$ and $d_2$ are two document vectors, then
\[
	\cos( d_1, d_2 ) = (d_1 \cdot d_2) / ||d_1|| ||d_2||
\]
where $\cdot$ indicates vector dot product and $||d||$ is the length of vector $d$.

Example:
\begin{align*}
	d_1 &= 3\ 2\ 0\ 5\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 2\ 0\ 0\\
	d_2 &= 1\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 2\\
	d_1 \cdot d_2 &= 3*1 + 2*0 + 0*0 + 5*0 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 2*1 + 0*0 + 0*2 = 5\\
	||d_1|| &= \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 + 5^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{42}\\
	||d_2|| &= \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{6}\\
	\cos(d_1, d_2) &= \frac{5}{\sqrt{42} * \sqrt{6}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{252}} \approx 0.315
\end{align*}


\subsection{Correlation}

\begin{paracol}{2}
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics{images/04/correlation.png}
		\caption{Scatter plots showing the similarity from -1 to 1}
		\label{fig:04/correlation}
	\end{figure}
	\switchcolumn
	\colfill
	Correlation measures the linear relationship between objects (binary or continuous).
	To compute correlation, we standardize data objects, $p$ and $q$, and then take their dot product (covariance/standard deviation).
	\colfill
\end{paracol}
	\[
		corr(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \frac{covariance(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{stddev(\mathbf{x})*stddev(\mathbf{y})} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k - \bar{x})(y_k - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n}(y_k - \bar{y})^2}}
		\]
		

\subsection{Entropy}
Information relates to possible outcomes of an event such as transmission of a message, flip of a coin, or measurement of a piece of data.
\ul{The amount of information is inversely related to the probability of an event}.
Entropy is the commonly used measure of information content.
For a discrete random variable $X$ with $n$ possible values ${x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$ each having probability $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$, the entropy $H(X)$ is defined as:
\[
H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log_2(p_i)
\]

Entropy is measured in bits and is $0 \leq H(X) \leq \log_2(n)$. Thus, entropy is a measure of how many bits it takes to represent an observation of $X$ on average.

The information one variable provides about another is called mutual information.
The mutual information $I(X;Y)$ of two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined as:
\[
I(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y) = \sum_{x \in X} \sum_{y \in Y} p(x,y) \log_2p(x,y)
\]
where $H(X,Y)$ is the joint entropy of $X$ and $Y$, and $p(x,y)$ is the probability that $x$ and $y$ occur together.

\section{K-Means}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Partitional} clustering approach
	\item The number of clusters $K$, must be specified
	\item Each cluster is associated with a \textbf{centroid} (center point), typically being the mean of the points in the cluster
	\item Each point is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid. This may measured as Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, correlation, etc.
	\note{Using these measures makes K-Means to converge in the first few iterations.}
	\item Complexity is $O(nKId)$, where $n$ is the number of data points, $K$ is the number of clusters, $I$ is the number of iterations, and $d$ is the number of dimensions (attributes)
	\item The basic algorithm is very simple
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{K-Means Clustering Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Select $K$ points as the initial centroids.
\Repeat
\State Form $K$ clusters by assigning all points to the closest centroid.
\State Recompute the centroid of each cluster.
\Until{The centroids don't change}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{images/04/kmeans.png}
	\caption{K-Means Clustering Iterations}
	\label{fig:kmeans}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluating K-Means clusters}
The most common measure to evaluate the quality of K-Means clusters is the \textbf{Sum of Squared Errors} (SSE), also known as \textbf{Inertia}. It quantifies how tightly the data points in a cluster are grouped around their centroid. The SSE is calculated as follows:
\[
SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2
\]
\note{
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $K$ is the number of clusters,
	\item $C_i$ is the set of points in cluster $i$,
	\item $x$ is a data point in cluster $C_i$,
	\item $\mu_i$ is the centroid of cluster $C_i$,
	\item $||x - \mu_i||^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance between point $x$ and centroid $\mu_i$.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Limitations of K-Means}

\begin{paracol}{2}
	\colfill
	K-means has problems when clusters are of differing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Clusters have different sizes
		\item Clusters have different densities
		\item Clusters have Non-globular shapes
		\item The data contains \textbf{outliers}.
	\end{itemize}
	\colfill
	\switchcolumn
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/04/kproblems.png}
		\caption{K-Means with different cluster sizes}
		A solution may be to use more clusters, hence increasing $K$, and then merging them.

	\label{fig:04/kdensity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Empty Clusters}

\begin{paracol}{2}
	
	K-Means sometimes produces empty clusters. This happens when no points are assigned to a cluster during the assignment step. This can occur if the initial centroids are poorly chosen or if the data distribution is such that certain centroids end up being too far from any data points.

	 Solutions include the following strategies, which may be iterated until no empty clusters remain:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Choose a point and assign it to the cluster
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Choose the point that contributes most to SSE
			\item Choose a point from the cluster with the highest SSE
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

		\includegraphics{images/04/kempty.png}
		\caption{K-Means with Empty Clusters}

	\end{figure}
\end{paracol}

\subsection{Workflow}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data Preprocessing
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Handle missing values
		      \item Normalize/standardize data
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Choose the number of clusters $K$
	\item Post processing and validation
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Eliminate small clusters that may represent outliers
		      \item Split ‘loose’ clusters, i.e., clusters with relatively high
		            SSE
		      \item Merge clusters that are ‘close’ and that have relatively
		            low SSE
		      \item Can use these steps during the clustering process\\
		            \texttt{ISODATA}
	      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Choosing the number of clusters K}
If there are K ``real'' clusters then the chance of selecting
one centroid from each cluster is small, especially if K is large.

A solution is to run K-Means multiple times with different initial centroids and choose the best result, but probability of getting a good result is still small.

A different approach is to use \textbf{hierarchical clustering} to determine initial centroids for K-Means.

Another option is to \textbf{incrementally} update centroids as points are assigned to clusters, instead of waiting until all points are assigned.
This is more expensive and introduces order dependence.
\nl

We can define a goodness measure of a cluster $c$ (hence of the set of Clusters $C$) as the SSE from the cluster centroid:
\begin{align}
	SSE_C(c,s) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_i, s_c)^2\\
	G(C,s) &= \sum_{c \in C} SSE_C(c,s)
\end{align}
where $s_c$ is the centroid of cluster $c$, $d_i$ is a point in cluster $c$, and $C$ is the set of clusters.

Re-assignment of points to clusters and re-computation of centroids is guaranteed to \textit{not increase} (or \textit{monotonically decreases}) $G(C,s)$, hence K-Means converges to a local minimum.

At any step we have some value for G(C,s),
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fix $s$, optimize $C$ $\rightarrow$ Assignment step: assign $d_i$ to the closest centroid $\Rightarrow G(C',s) \leq G(C,s)$
	\item Fix $C'$, optimize $s$ $\rightarrow$ Update step: recompute centroids $\Rightarrow G(C',s') \leq G(C',s) \leq G(C,s)$
\end{enumerate}
In this way the new cost results smaller than the original one, leading to convergence to a local minimum.

\section{Hierarchical Clustering}

Hierarchical clustering produces a set of nested clusters organized as a
hierarchical tree can be visualized as a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits.

We do not have to assume any particular number of clusters, any desired number of clusters can be obtained by ``cutting'' the dendrogram at the proper level, each possibly corresponding to meaningful taxonomies.

\subsection{Agglomerative vs Divisive}

There are two types of hierarchical clustering, both exploiting a similarity or distance matrix:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Agglomerative} (bottom-up)\\
	Start with the points as individual clusters, and, at each step, merge the closest pair of clusters until only one cluster (or $k$ clusters) remain.
	\item \textbf{Divisive} (top-down)\\
	Start with all points in one cluster and, at each step, split the cluster into smaller clusters until each point is its own cluster (or $k$ clusters are formed).
\end{itemize}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Compute the proximity matrix
\State Let each data point be a cluster
\Repeat
\State Merge the two closest clusters
\State Update the proximity matrix
\Until{only a single cluster remains}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\note{\textbf{Proximity} matrix is a square matrix that contains the distances (or similarities) between each pair of data points.\\
``Proximity'' is just a general term that can refer to either distance or similarity, depending on the context.}

\subsubsection{Updating Proximity Matrix}
When two clusters $c_i$ and $c_j$ are merged into a new cluster $c_k$, we need to update the proximity matrix to reflect the distances between the new cluster $c_k$ and all other existing clusters. There are several methods to do this, each defining the distance between clusters differently:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Single Linkage} (or Nearest Neighbor)
	The distance between two clusters is defined as the minimum distance between any single point in the first cluster and any single point in the second cluster.
	\[d(c_i, c_j) = \min_{x \in c_i, y \in c_j} d(x, y)\]
	\item \textbf{Complete Linkage} (or Farthest Neighbor)
	The distance between two clusters is defined as the maximum distance between any single point in the first cluster and any single point in the second cluster.
	\[d(c_i, c_j) = \max_{x \in c_i, y \in c_j} d(x, y)\]
	\item \textbf{Average Linkage}
	The distance between two clusters is defined as the average distance between all pairs of points, one from each cluster.
	\[d(c_i, c_j) = \frac{1}{|c_i| |c_j|} \sum_{x \in c_i} \sum_{y \in c_j} d(x, y)\]

	\note{Note that \ul{\textbf{Single}, \textbf{Complete} and \textbf{Average} Linkage have all the same complexity}! $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data points.}
	% \item \textbf{Mean/Median Linkage}
	% The distance between two clusters is defined as the distance between their centroids (mean or median).
	% \[d(c_i, c_j) = d(\mu_i, \mu_j)\]
	% where $\mu_i$ and $\mu_j$ are the centroids of clusters $c_i$ and $c_j$, respectively.
	\item \textbf{Centroid Linkage}
	The distance between two clusters is defined as the distance between their centroids.
	\[d(c_i, c_j) = d(\mu_i, \mu_j)\]
	where $\mu_i$ and $\mu_j$ are the centroids of clusters $c_i$ and $c_j$, respectively.
	\item \textbf{Ward's Method}
	This method minimizes the total within-cluster variance. When two clusters are merged, the increase in the total within-cluster variance is calculated, and the pair of clusters that results in the smallest increase is merged.
	\[d(c_i, c_j) = \frac{|c_i| |c_j|}{|c_i| + |c_j|} ||\mu_i - \mu_j||^2\]
	where $|c_i|$ and $|c_j|$ are the sizes of clusters $c_i$ and $c_j$, and $\mu_i$ and $\mu_j$ are their centroids.

\subsection{Divisive Hierarchical Clustering}
First of all, build MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) of the data points, then iteratively remove the longest edge in the MST to split the data into clusters.\\
Start with a single cluster which consists of any point, and at each step, look for the closest pair of points $p,q$ such that $p$ is in the current tree while $q$ is not.
Add $q$ to the tree and the edge $(p,q)$ to the MST. Repeat until all points are in the tree.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Divisive Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Compute a MST for the proximity graph
\Repeat
\State Create a new cluster by breaking the link corresponding to the longest edge in the MST (smallest proximity)
\Until only singleton clusters remain
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Complexity and Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time Complexity - $O(n^3)$ for naive implementations of hierarchical clustering
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $O(n^2)$ to compute the proximity matrix
		      \item $O(n)$ to find the closest pair of clusters
		      \item $O(n)$ to update the proximity matrix
		      \item Repeated $n$ times
	      \end{itemize}
	More efficient algorithms can achieve $O(n^2 \log n)$.
	\item Space Complexity - $O(n^2)$ for storing the proximity matrix
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
Once a decision is made to combine two clusters,
it cannot be undone.\\
No global objective function is directly minimized.\\
Different schemes have problems with one or
more of the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sensitivity to noise and outliers
	\item Difficulty handling clusters of different sizes and non-
globular shapes
	\item Breaking large clusters
\end{itemize}

\section{Density based - DBSCAN}

\begin{definition}
	[Density]
	\textbf{Density} is the number of points within a specified radius (\textsc{Eps} or $\epsilon$).
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{images/04/densitypoints.png}
	\caption{Core, Border, and Noise Points in DBSCAN}
	\label{fig:04/densitypoints}
\end{figure}

A point is a \textbf{core point} if it has at least \textsc{MinPts} points within distance \textsc{Eps} (including itself). These are points which are at the interior of a cluster.\\
A point is a \textbf{border point} if it has fewer than \textsc{MinPts} points within distance \textsc{Eps}, but is in the neighborhood of a core point. These are points which are on the edge of a cluster.\\
A point is a \textbf{noise point} (or outlier) if it is neither a core point nor a border point. These are points which are not part of any cluster.

\labelitemize{DBSCAN}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Label points as core, border, or noise based on thresholds $R$ (radius of neighborhood) and \lstinline|min_pts| (min number of neighbors)
		\item Connect core points that are within $R$ of each other, hence are neighbors, putting them in the same cluster
		\item Associate border points to the nearest core point, hence to the same cluster as the core point, and remove noise.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{DBSCAN Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $current\_cluster\_label \gets 0$
\For{all core points}
	\If{the core point has no cluster label}
		\State $current\_cluster\_label \gets current\_cluster\_label + 1$
		\State Label the current core point with cluster label $current\_cluster\_label$
	\EndIf
	\For{all points in the $Eps$-neighborhood, except $i^{th}$ the point itself}
		\If{the point does not have a cluster label}
			\State Label the point with cluster label $current\_cluster\_label$
		\EndIf
	\EndFor
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\framedt{Determining \textsc{Eps} and \textsc{MinPts}}{
	To determine \textsc{Eps} and \textsc{MinPts}, we can use the k-distance graph.

	The idea is that for points in a cluster, their $k^{th}$ nearest
	neighbors are at roughly the same distance
	Noise points have the $k^{th}$ nearest neighbor at distance.

	So, plot sorted distance of every point to its $k^{th}$ nearest neighbor.
