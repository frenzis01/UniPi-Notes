\section{Agents}

Agents are entities that perceive their environment and act upon it. They can be human or AI. They can be grounded with an app, which is a way to interact with the environment.

Back in the day a \textit{Travel Agent} was a person you could ask things like ``Book a trip to the sun for me and my family''.
Then they were replaced by websites, which however may still be difficult to use for non-agents.
