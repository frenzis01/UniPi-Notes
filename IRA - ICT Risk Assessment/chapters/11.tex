\section{Robust Programming}
Ideally it indicates a programming style focused on minimizing vulnerabilities and the impact of any vulnerability still exploitable.

\textbf{Robust programming} can be summarized with a few guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textit{Validate} program inputs aka input is evil
   \item \textit{Prevent} buffer overflow aka check sizes
   \item A robust implementation minimizes any \textit{information leaked outside} 
   e.g. module, object, function ...
   \note{
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Logical pointers rather than physical ones
         \item Validate any information that is exchanged
      \end{itemize}
   }
   \item Check values transmitted to other functions (egress filtering)
   \item Check returned results
\end{enumerate}
Besides, it is important to focus also on \textbf{interaction controls},
robustness must be enforced on both malicious and erroneous behaviour.

\subsection{Input validation}
Usually input validation is achieved with a form of \textit{default \textbf{deny}} by defining a legal input structure and discarding every input which doesn't satisfy it.
\note{In case of string this may be done through RegEx, max length, ...}

It is important that the checks to validate the input should be specified when the program is designed rather than after an attack;
besides a check should be designed in an simple and readable way,
to easily ensure its correctness.
Some examples of input which usually must be validated are:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Environment variables
   \item File names (blanks, .., /)
   \item Email addresses
   \item URL
   \item HTML headers/body
   \item Data
\end{itemize} 

Memory allocation and strings length is a crucial aspect:
only library functions with an explicit string length specified should be used\footnote{e.g. \lstinline|strncpy()| instead of \lstinline|strcpy()|},
and in general,
it is appropriate to
allocate only the memory actually needed by a data structure according to its sizeto avoid leaving
space to store dangerous values or inputs.\nl

Speaking of functions,
attention must be paid to a rigorous \textbf{interfaces definition} and to avoid making assumptions on relationships between input and output values of function;
in other words, if a function $A$ takes as input the value $x$ returned by $B$,
it must not be \textit{asserted} that $x$ is for sure a \textbf{valid} value,
$B$ should check the correctness of the input regardless of knowing how it was generated.

\subsection{CWE - Vulnerabilities Ranking}
\href{https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html#tableView}{This article} by \textit{\textbf{CWE}} (\textit{Common Weaknesses Enumeration}) lists the most dangerous and frequent software weaknesses of 2023,
based on data provided by \textit{NIST}.

The scoring formula to calculate a ranked order of weaknesses
considers the \textbf{frequency} a CWE is the root cause of a vulnerability
with the \textbf{severity} of its exploitation. Both frequency and severity are
\textit{normalized} relative to the minimum and maximum values seen.
\textbf{Frequency} is obtained by counting weaknesses occurences in the \textit{National Vulnerabilities Database} (NVD),
while \textbf{severity} is the average computed on the Vulnerabilities score in the \textit{CVSS}\footnote{\textit{Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System}} a given weakness is mapped to.\\
The \textbf{final weakness score} is computed by multiplying frequency and severity scores.

\subsubsection{Biases and limitations}
There are two biases which CWE doesn't take into account,
which somehow negatively affect how valid CWE's scores are:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Metric bias}
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
      Indirect prioritization of implementation faults over design flaws
      \item 
      Prefers frequency over severity due to distributions of real-world
   \end{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Data bias}
   \item \begin{enumerate}
      \item Only uses NVD data based on publicly-reported CVE Records
      \item Many CVEs do not have sufficient details to assign a CWE
      mapping, omitting them from ranking
      \item There may be an over-representation of certain programming
      languages, frameworks, or weakness-detection techniques
   \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} 

There also a few aspects which this scoring system cannot represent and should be taken care of.
First of all,
weaknesses that are rarely discovered will not receive a high score,
regardless of the consequence of an exploitation.
Weaknesses that begin with a root cause of a mistake leading to
other mistakes, create a chain relationship.
As we have seen, chains of mistakes/vulnerabilities/attacks are a key point in security,
but CWE's scoring system treats any $\langle V_1, V_2 \rangle \wedge V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ as if $V_1$ and $V_2$ were independent i.e. $V_1 \not\rightarrow V_2$.


\section{Firewall}
A \textbf{firewall} is a module to filter all the messages exchanged by \textit{two} networks with a distinct security level;
\textit{all and only} the messages travelling on the wires
connecting the two networks cross the firewall and therefore get filtered.
A firewall works correctly under the assumption that a network has been split (\textit{segmented}) into two \textbf{subnets}, 
and that it \textit{correctly implements} a security policy, which should \textit{\textbf{not}} define the policy by itself.
Firewalls are usually \textbf{classified} on the known and manageable \textbf{protocols} and on their \textbf{implementation}.

\subsection{Segmenting}
Firewalling goes along with \textbf{segmenting} a network,
which results in multiple subnets with different security levels whose interaction is determined by firewalls inbetween them.
This architecture increases \textbf{robustness} by preventing an attacker from having \textbf{initial access} on an entire system and from freely performing \textbf{lateral movements};
besides this architecture perfectly integrates with \textbf{honeypot} deception mechanisms.

\subsection{Classification}
Firewall may operate on different levels of the TCP/IP stack and in different ways:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Packet filtering firewall
   \item Circuit-level gateway
   \item Application-level gateway (aka \textit{Proxy Firewall}):
   firewall which recognizes application level protocols and can make assumptions on it
   \item Stateful inspection firewall
   \textit{Stateful} means that the firewall inspects also the contents of a communication and the properties related to the status of a connection.
   \item Next-generation firewall (NGFW)
\end{itemize} 

At level 3 (IP Packet Inspection) the firewall can check only the header of IP packets,
while at level 4 (circuit level firewall) ...\nl

\subsection*{Proxies}
\textbf{Proxies} protect clients from attacks from an external server,
while \textbf{reverse proxies} protect internal servers from attacks by external agents, 
besides they can also act as a load balancer.

\subsection{Wrapping Up}
\textbf{Stateful inspection} is the most common technology:
it works at the network layer and provides
dynamic packet filtering.
While packet filtering examines information in a
packet header, stateful inspection tracks each connection traversing any
firewall interface and confirms they are valid.
It is a system backed up by a state table that
tracks all sessions and inspects all packets passing through: 
if packets have
the properties the state table predicts, they can pass, otherwise they don't.
Clearly the state table changes
dynamically according to traffic flow.

\subsection{Takeaway guidelines}
These are the guidelines according to SNAS which indicate "suspicious" traffic \textbf{outgoing} from your network,
thus the network traffic which should be \textbf{egress-filtered}.
\begin{itemize}
   \item All traffic directed to IP addresses in your network(or that you manage)
   \item MS RPC (TCP/UDP 135), NetBIOS/IP (TCP/UDP 137-139), SMB/IP (TCP/445)
   \item Trivial File Transfer Protocol - TFTP (UDP/69)
   \item Syslog (UDP/514)
   \item Simple Network Management Protocol – SNMP (UDP 161-162)
   \item SMTP from all but your mail server
   \item Internet Relay Chat IRC (TCP 6660-6669)
   \item ICMP Echo/Reply
   \item ICMP Host Unreachable
\end{itemize}

\section{Segmentation}

A \textbf{segmented} network forces an attacker to adopt \textbf{pivoting},
which is attacking a host only to exploit it to route traffic to other nodes or subnets,
usually this is achieved with the aid of a \textbf{beacon} to remotely control the host.
Hence, in general, segmentation leads the attacker to implement \textit{more} attacks.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics{images/pivoting.png}
   \caption{Segmented network and the need for Pivoting}
   \label{fig:pivoting}
\end{figure}

The attacker needs to perform pivoting to intrude in the network, thus they need to attack at least one host in left subnet and one in the right subnet;
otherwise they'd need to attack the firewall, but generally this is more costful in terms of effort and resources.

It is also possible to combine \textbf{firewalls} and \textbf{honeypots}.
They can be placed either in the internal network amongst other nodes or between the router and the global/outside network.
