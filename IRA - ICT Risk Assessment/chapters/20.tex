\chapter{System Design View}


\section{Thesis = Fuzzing Hardware}
Baiardi is interested in \textit{Fuzzing Hardware},
he would like to do a thesis on such topic.

\section{System View}
\textbf{System view} is a perspective aiming to consider \textit{design rules} and consequentently \textit{vulnerabilities},
focusing on wrong design choices rather than
implementation error.
A set of design rules is used to determine the \textit{optimal} set of \textbf{controls} for a system, where \textit{optimal} indicates the smallest (i.e. \textit{cheapest} \smiley)set of controls to achieve the required robustness.\\
It is important to understand whether the optimal set of controls as imposed
by the design rules is compatible with the required performance,
and from this point of view we can define a \textbf{vulnerability} as a \textit{violation} of system design rules.

\subsection{Robustness agains Vulnerabilities}
Thus, in this scenario, designing a system means finding an acceptable \textbf{tradeoff} between \textit{design rules} and \textit{vulnerabilities}.

All the modules in an ideal system satisfy the design rules,and such ideal system is the asymptote of a sequence of distinct systems each applying more controls than the previous one as required by the design rules.\\
Any difference between the ideal system and the one being
created/under analysis may be considered as a \textbf{vulnerability},
but to decide if it is an actual vulnerability we consider the \textbf{context}
and the \textbf{cost} of the control against its usefulness.

Some differences between the ideal system and the current one cannot be avoided, supponsing some rules have been violated due to {---}possibly basic{---} performance requirements.
Other violations (i.e. \textit{missing controls}) instead may be unrelated to
performance, hence they should be fixed.\\
The key strategy to discover vulnerabilities evaluates the cost of
missing controls and compares it against
\begin{itemize}
   \item the required final \textit{performance}
   \item the \textit{risk} ($\mathcal{P}(intrusion) *impact$) due to the missing control
\end{itemize}
In a whole-system comprehensive view it is important to check \textbf{compensative controls}, i.e.
a missing control in a module may be compensated by a
control in another one.
